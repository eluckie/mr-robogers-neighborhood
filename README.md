## Description

This webpage is intended to be a play on Mr. Roger's Neighborhood and explore JavaScript capabilities. Users are asked to input a number in the form. An array is formed starting from 0 to the number they input and then displayed back to them in numerical order with certain substitutions.

* If a number in the array contains a 1 (but **not** a 2 or 3), the number is replaced with the phrase "Beep!"
* If a number in the array contains a 2 (**including** if it contains a 1, but **not** if it includes a 3), the number is replaced with the phrase "Boop!"
* If a number in the array contains a 3 (**including** if it contains a 1 or 2), the number is replaced with the phrase "Won't you be my neighbor?"
* If a number in the array **does not contain** a 1, 2, or 3, the number is displayed back in true form.
